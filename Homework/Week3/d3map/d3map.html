      <font face='cambria' size='3'>
        When scrolling over a country, information about the country name, code and population density will pop up.<br>
        The borders of a country will get solid as well, which will make it clear which country you are looking at.<br></br>

        There are seven colours to signify what the population density for the respective country is.<br>
        Seven seems a high enough number to represent all countries in the world, yet not quite too high for a colour to be meaningless or confusing on the first sight.
        Also based on an Excel data analysis, a relatively high number of classes seemed more appropriate.<br>
        It is a multi hue scheme in order to separate between high and low density easier than with a single hue scheme. As seven classes are being used, a distinguishing scheme appears to be more appropriate.
        However, the colours are still similar in hue.<br>
        The colour-classes are chosen based on a spread of the population density values as an Microsoft Excel graph, with varying reach values for the y-axis. The median value is 82, however the average is 413.<br>
        <br>
        The colour-classes are as follows:<br>
        <img src='http://i.imgur.com/Oy5ASK9.png' alt='Color Scheme Image'></img><br>
        - Extremely low, white-orange (#fed976): population density between 0 and 15.<br>
        - Very low, light-orange (#feb24c): population density between 15 and 50.<br>
        - Low, orange (#fd8d3c): population density between 50 and 70.<br>
        - Medium, orange-red (#fc4e2a): population density between 70 and 100.<br>
        - High, red (#e31a1c): population density between 100 and 250.<br>
        - Very high, dark red (#bd0026): population density between 250 and 700.<br>
        - Extremely high, black-red (#800026): population density higher than (or equal to) 700.<br><br>

        - Very light yellow is the default fill (#fdedba), if there is no data about this country.<br>
        Usually this means the value would be extremely low, so that is why I have chosen to pick a very light colours to represent these countries. However, be aware that this is merely an assumption!<br>

        <br>
        The colours are hierarchical in design, which means similar in hue: a darker/stronger colour tends to specify a higher population density number than a lighter colour.
        This is intuitive to understand.

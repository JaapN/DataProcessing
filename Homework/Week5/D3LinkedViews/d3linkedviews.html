        When scrolling over a country on the map, information about the country name and HPI will pop up.<br>
        The borders of a country will get green as well, which will make it clear which country you are looking at.<br></br>

        The new HPI results show the extent to which 151 countries across the globe produce long, happy and sustainable lives for the people that live in them.<br>
        The overall index scores rank countries based on their efficiency, how many long and happy lives each produces per unit of environmental output.<br>
        <br>
        Each of the three component measures - life expectancy, experienced well-being and Ecological Footprint - is given a traffic-light score based on thresholds for good (green), middling (amber) and bad (red) performance. <br>
        These scores are combined to an expanded six-colour traffic light for the overall HPI score, where, to achieve bright green - the best of the six colours, a country would have to perform well on all three individual components.<br>
        <br>
        The scores for the HPI and the component measures can be viewed in map or graph-form. By clicking on any individual country in the map you can explore its results in more detail in its graph.<br>
